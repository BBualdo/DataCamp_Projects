# 💰 Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data

### Project Description
Data cleaning is an essential skill for data engineers, encompassing reading, modifying, splitting, and storing data.

In this notebook, you will apply your data-cleaning skills to process information about marketing campaigns run by a bank.

You will need to modify values, add new features, convert data types, and save data into multiple files.

## 🎯 Objective

Subset, clean, and reformat the `bank_marketing.csv` dataset to create and store three new files based on the requirements detailed in the notebook.

Split and tidy bank_marketing.csv, storing as three DataFrames called `client`, `campaign`, and `economics`, each containing the columns outlined in the notebook and formatted to the data types listed.
Save the three DataFrames to csv files, without an index, as `client.csv`, `campaign.csv`, and `economics.csv` respectively.
